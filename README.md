# BulletHellJam

CPU Takeover is a bullet-hell, top-down, twin-stick shooter where the player must destroy an evil virus, hacking the computer system.

To do this, they must attack it while surviving its attacks and the waves of enemies it spawns.

Luckily enemies drop powerups to aid the player. And due to a bug in the code, having near misses with bullets will freeze time and delay the spawning of more enemies.

This was made as part of the Bullet Hell Jam 2021 (https://itch.io/jam/bullet-jam-2021) where the theme was "10 seconds", hence that's why the boss switches attacks/spawns enemies every 10 seconds. It was later polished to be submitted into the Game Development World Championship of that same year.

It has twin stick shooting, with an option for both mouse/keyboard or controller, using Unity's Input System. The player can dash to avoid the bullets, and can grab powerups. The game is very inspired by arcade games, and is challenging and has a scoring system.
